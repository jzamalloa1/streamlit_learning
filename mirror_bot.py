# WE'LL BUILD AN SCROLLABLE, MESSAGE-RETAINER CHATBOT NOW
#  Mirroring user's input for this exercise
# We'll need:
    # Two message containers to display the user's and bot's message
    # A chat input widget to take user's input
    # A way to store the messages and display them as a rolling list
